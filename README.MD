## Abstract

The goal is to design database of personal knowledge. Lot of people – software developers, writers, actors, teachers, artists do the only thing – reproduce, processes and creates new information. From some perspective knowledge can be seen as graph, and the goal is to find approach, that will connect all the personal knowledge of individuals into one community knowledge.

## Introduction

Human brains can't remember all the information received as an input: videos seen, articles read, theorems learned, jokes remembered – with time the brain looses memories. The reason is simple - human brain has very limited capabilites in terms of memory, we just not design to process all the information that happens around.

On the other hand computers can handle enormous amount of information. The problem is that computers yet do not "understand" data as humans does.

Our capabilities with computer interaction mostly limited not by our sensoric systems, but rather the difference in the way human brains and computers. Even direct cable to the brain won't significantly increase our intelligence. It'll increase the speed of data to be delivered to sensors, but it won't speed up the process of understanding meanings.

This document attemtps to formulate math model of human brain data processing pipline to design software that will help people to prosess large quantities of information.

##Specification

<a name="specification-technical-requirements"></a>
### Technical requirements

1. Spec1: One-click information adding
2. Spec2: Systems stores and indexes all the added information
3. Spec3: Systems allows to store relationship between objects in a different form (analytically and manually)
4. Spec4: System must be crosspalform
5. Spec5: System must be able to data in a form of table, graph, chart on one screen, block texts editors
6. Spec6: User must be able to store all the data locally
7. Spec7: Systems must be able to communicate to each other. User must be able to control what information him shares with others.
8. Spec8: System must be extenseble and able to connect to different data sources.
9. Spec9: System must be able to join data from different sources
10. Spec10: System must work async
11. Spec11: System must have advanced collision resoultion capabilities

### Design requirements

1. Dis1: Systems must be adapted to humans
2. Dis2: It must be convinient to use the system
3. Dis3: Several color themes
4. Dis4: Minimalistic interface
5. Dis5: System must have great internal documentation
6. Dis6: Internal documentation must be implemented on the system
7. Dis7: System must be responsible
