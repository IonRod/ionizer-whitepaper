## Abstract

Proposed design of a computer system that will memorize everything for a person providing him with an individual memory search.

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

Human brains can't remember all the information received as an input: videos seen, articles read, theorems learned, jokes remembered â€“ with time the brain looses memories. The reason is simple - human brain has very limited capabilites in terms of memory, we just not design to process all the information that happens around.

On the other hand computers can handle enormous amount of information. The problem is that computers yet do not "understand" data as humans does.

Our capabilities with computer interaction mostly limited not by our sensoric systems, but rather the difference in the way human brains and computers. Even direct cable to the brain won't significantly increase our intelligence. It'll increase the speed of data to be delivered to sensors, but it won't speed up the process of understanding meanings.

This document attemtps to formulate math model of human brain data processing pipline to design software that will help people to prosess large quantities of information.
